# 👋 Hi, I’m Igor Razumny – Freelance ML Consultant

## 👋 About Me

I help healthcare and life sciences organizations design and deploy GenAI-powered systems that improve data quality, streamline workflows, and support intelligent decision-making.

With 16+ years of program leadership experience (including 10+ in healthcare), I specialize in bridging strategic AI planning with hands-on implementation. I'm certified in Python and Java, and currently pursuing cloud ML and security certifications across GCP, AWS, and Azure.

My journey in AI began in 2005 with a bachelor thesis focused on building a C++-based virtual soccer team for the RoboCup simulation league. The system combined multi-agent coordination, real-time decision-making, and strategic behavior modeling—laying the foundation for my long-term focus on intelligent, data-driven systems in applied domains.
