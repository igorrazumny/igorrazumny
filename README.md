## 👤 About Me

Secure, compliant GenAI for healthcare — from strategy to production.

I specialize in designing and delivering ML and GenAI solutions for the healthcare industry. With over 16 years of program management experience and hands-on AI development, I help organizations bridge strategy and execution — securely.

My AI journey began in 2005 with a bachelor thesis on a C++-based virtual soccer team for the RoboCup simulation league. Today, I focus on integrating AI/ML into enterprise environments, aligning emerging technologies with business goals, compliance frameworks, and real-world impact. I’m certified in Python and Java, and currently pursuing cloud ML and security certifications across GCP, AWS, and Azure.
