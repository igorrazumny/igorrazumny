## 👤 About Me

**Lean-Agile Leader | Freelance ML Consultant | AI Systems for Healthcare**

I help healthcare and life sciences organizations design and deploy GenAI-powered systems that improve data quality, streamline workflows, and support intelligent decision-making.

With over 16 years of program leadership experience (10+ in healthcare), I specialize in bridging strategic AI planning with hands-on implementation. I’ve led cross-functional teams of 100+ and managed multi-million dollar initiatives, consistently delivering value in regulated (GxP) environments.

My core strength lies in integrating AI/ML into enterprise settings—aligning emerging technologies with business objectives and compliance requirements. I’m certified in Python and Java, and currently working toward cloud ML and security certifications across GCP, AWS, and Azure.

My journey in AI began in 2005 with a bachelor thesis focused on building a C++-based virtual soccer team for the RoboCup simulation league. This early work on multi-agent systems and real-time decision-making laid the foundation for my data-centric approach to applied machine learning today.
