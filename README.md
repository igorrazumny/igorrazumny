## ðŸ‘¤ About Me

**Lean-Agile Leader | Freelance ML Consultant | AI Systems for Healthcare**

I help healthcare and life sciences organizations design and deploy GenAI-powered systems that improve data quality, streamline workflows, and support intelligent decision-making.

With over 16 years of program leadership experience (10+ in healthcare), I specialize in bridging strategic AI planning with hands-on implementation. Iâ€™ve led cross-functional teams of 100+ and managed multi-million dollar initiatives, consistently delivering value in regulated (GxP) environments.

My core strength lies in integrating AI/ML into enterprise settingsâ€”aligning emerging technologies with business objectives and compliance requirements. Iâ€™m certified in Python and Java, and currently working toward cloud ML and security certifications across GCP, AWS, and Azure.

My journey in AI began in 2005 with a bachelor thesis focused on building a C++-based virtual soccer team for the RoboCup simulation league. This early work on multi-agent systems and real-time decision-making laid the foundation for my data-centric approach to applied machine learning today.
