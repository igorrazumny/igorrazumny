## 👤 About Me

I design and deliver secure, compliant systems for the healthcare industry — from strategy to production.

With a strong focus on data protection, GxP compliance, and robust enterprise integration, I bring over 10 years of experience in GxP-regulated healthcare and 16 years in program management. I operate across the stack — from enterprise architecture and solution design to hands-on AI development — helping organizations bridge the gap between innovation and security-critical execution.

My AI journey began in 2003 with a thesis on multi-agent systems in C++, and I remain deeply technical today — building GenAI-powered tools for data quality validation, financial reporting, and process optimization using Python and cloud-native frameworks such as Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT, and AWS AI services.
